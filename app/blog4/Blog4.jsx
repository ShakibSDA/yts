            <strong>Vaccinations</strong>
            <br />
            Meningococcal A, C, W135 and Y is obligatory for protection against
            viral infection and it is mandatory to take this vaccination before
            you embark on this pilgrimage. Your family doctor will administer
            this vaccine to you and also advise you on the other vaccinations
            that you need to take before proceeding on the pilgrimage.

            <strong>Hydration</strong>
            <br />
            Throughout the Hajj and Umrah pilgrimage, pilgrim tend to lose a
            substantial quantity of liquids through sweating. Intense physical
            activity and a hot climate will greatly increase your thirst. In
            order to maintain the adequate level of hydration, you should make
            it a point to drink plenty of fluids to compensate for the fluids
            lost through sweating. Water, both bottled and from clean water
            fountains, is the best form of fluid for combating hydration,
            therefore you should keep on drinking it continuously, along with
            other fluids such as juice, milk and tea.

            <strong>Health &amp; Safety</strong>
            <br />
            Being healthy is one of the prerequisites of successfully performing
            Hajj and Umrah. Only when you are in good health will you be able to
            do all the rituals associated with both the pilgrimages and become a
            Haji. Should you have a health condition which you feel will be a
            hindrance in performing the pilgrimage, we suggest you seek your
            doctor&rsquo;s advice and take it from him or her in writing that
            you are medically fit for undertaking the journey to the holy land.
            If your health condition permits the travel, and if you&rsquo;re on
            medication, be sure to carry supply which will be enough to last you
            throughout the pilgrimage.

            <strong>Skin Friction</strong>
            <br />
            The long periods of walking for performing the Hajj and Umrah
            rituals can lead to chafing of the skin, particularly around the
            inner thighs, due to the continuous rubbing and sweating of the
            thighs. This is more pronounced in overweight pilgrims. Before you
            begin your walking for completing the ritual, we suggest you apply
            Vaseline or another non-scented moisturiser around this area or any
            other area where you feel that the skin is likely to chafe.

            <strong>Peculiar condition of female pilgrims</strong>
            <br />
            Female pilgrims face the natural problem of menstruation and this
            can be a big hindrance to them in performing the rituals of Hajj and
            Umrah. Tawaf-ul-Ziyarah, or circumambulating around the Kaaba, can
            be performed by female pilgrims in a state of purification or when
            they are not menstruating. If the pilgrim is not able to complete
            this ritual, her Hajj will not be complete. Also, If a female
            pilgrim begins to menstruate toward the end of the pilgrimage, it
            becomes mandatory for her to remain in Makkah until her periods are
            over, and she only then she can perform the Tawaf. This will lead to
            either her splitting from her Hajj group or not being able to take
            the return flight on which she is booked along with her group.
            Sisters can medically delay their period for a limited period by
            using Norethisterone. You &nbsp;GP will tell you exactly when and
            how you should use it.&nbsp;

            <strong>Haji Flu</strong>
            <br />
            Haji Flu refers to a highly common respiratory tract infection
            affecting the Hajj pilgrims arising due to crowded conditions within
            a confined area and coming in close contact with others. Before you
            leave UK for your pilgrimage, you should get yourself vaccinated for
            Haji Flu from your family doctor.

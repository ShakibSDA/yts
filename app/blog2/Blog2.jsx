            <strong>Seek forgiveness before your pilgrimage </strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            When there are some days left for your departure to the holy land
            for perform the sacred pilgrimage, you should meet your relatives
            and friends and seek their forgiveness.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you have difference with someone or are not on talking terms with
            them, you should meet them and resolve your differences, rather than
            performing the pilgrimage while keeping the grudge in your heart and
            mind.
          </p>

          <p>
            Keep in mind that the purpose of making this journey is to seek
            acceptance of our deeds and our shortcomings from Allah.
          </p>

          <p>
            It is important tat you are kind and compassionate towards your
            family, relatives and friends, ask them for forgiveness for any of
            your wrongdoings and also forgive them for any of their wrongdoings.
          </p>

          <p>
            <br />
            <strong>Preparing your body is important</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            Be prepared for exertion and tiredness during your pilgrimage, as it
            will surely take a physical toll on your body. During the entire
            pilgrimage, you will walk much more than you have walked earlier.
          </p>

          <p>
            To give you an example, the distance of the walking ritual between
            Safa and Marwa for commemorating the painful journey undertaken by
            Lady Hajar to find water for her son, is more than 3 km.
          </p>

          <p>
            We suggest you prepare for this ritual by walking briskly daily for
            at least 5 miles in one session. This will ensure that when you have
            to walk during Hajj and Umrah, your body will not feel too tired,
            and you will be able to comfortably perform the rituals.
          </p>

          <p>
            <br />
            <strong>Preparing the mind </strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            For truly appreciating all the sacred rituals of Hajj and Umrah, it
            is important to keep two things in mind, Dhikr (remembrance) and
            Taslim (complete submission to Allah).
          </p>

          <p>
            <br />
            <strong>DHIKR</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            During the entire pilgrimage, you should keep Allah in our mind and
            keep reminding yourself of the objective of your holy journey. You
            should do this by regularly repeating the Talbiyah &ldquo;Here I
            come to Allah to perform Umrah or Hajj.&rdquo;
          </p>

          <p>
            <br />
            <strong>TASLIM</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            Without wondering about the purpose of each ritual of Hajj and
            Umrah, you should completely and unconditionally surrender to the
            will of Allah, taking inspiration of the saying of Prophet Muhammad
            ï·º &ldquo;Take from me your rituals&rdquo;. You should fully believe
            in the fact that all of Islam&rsquo;s rituals come from Allah and
            his Messenger and are filled with meaning. All we have to do is
            simply surrender to the will and order of Allah, and humbly do what
            He has ordained for us.

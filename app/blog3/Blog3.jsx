            <strong>What to take</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            Probably the most common questions on the mind of pilgrims when
            preparing for their Hajj or Umrah are &ldquo;What should I take
            along?&rdquo; and &ldquo;What should I wear?&rdquo;.
          </p>

          <p>
            For answering your queries, we share a list of common but useful
            items that we recommend you carry along. We also suggest that you
            speak with those in family and with friends who have performed Hajj
            or Umrah, to check for any items this list might not include.

            <br />
            <strong>Buy a strong suitcase</strong>
            <br />
            Your luggage will have a rough and tough journey on the pilgrimage,
            so we recommend that you carry a suitcase with a hard outing, so
            that it can withstand the shocks all along the way. Also it is
            extremely important that you hand label your luggage differently to
            identify it from the thousands of similar styles and colours.&nbsp;
          </p>

          <p>
            <br />
            <strong>What to wear</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            We highlight different dress codes for men and women so that they
            can perform their pilgrimage comfortably.
          </p>

          <p>For Male Pilgrims:</p>

          <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
            <li>Ihram</li>
            <li>Comfortable sandals and shoes</li>
            <li>Belt, safety pins etc.</li>
            <li>
              Comfortable thawb with pyjamas or normal comfortable clothing
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            <br />

            <strong>For female pilgrims:</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            Abayah or Shalwar Kameez
            <br />
            Loose, comfortable clothes with pyjamas, loose trousers, underneath
            <br />
            Comfortable and soft shoes and sandals. Start wearing your new
            footwear to get comfortable with them.
            <br />
            If your current shoes and sandals are fit for use during the
            pilgrimage.
            <br />
            Crocs will be ideal for both Male and Female pilgrims. We recommend
            them &nbsp;because they are light and dry quickly.&nbsp;
            <br />
            For performing Wudu, Crocs are the ideal footwear
            <br />
            Carry flip flops only if you are used to wearing them comfortably
          </p>

          <p>
            As Hajj and Umrah involve a lot of walking, we suggest you carry
            pairs of strong, comfortable and long-lasting footwear.

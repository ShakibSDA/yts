          <p>
            Before entering the sacred state of IHRAM, which is necessary before
            beginning your UMRAH, it is mandatory to do the following:
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
            <li>Remove unwanted hair, clip nails, trim moustache etc</li>
            <li>Make Ghusl (if possible) or make Wudhu</li>
            <li>Wear Ihram prior to arriving at the Meeqat</li>
            <li>Pray 2 raka&#39;at (optional)</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            <br />
            After doing all of the above, you should make an intention for
            performing Umrah by reciting the following words:
          </p>

          <p>
            &ldquo;Allah humma inni ureedul amrata fa yas-sir haa lee wa
            taqabbal haa minni &quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &ldquo;O Allah, I intend to perform Umrah; make it easy for me and
            accept from me&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            <br />
            For entering the state of Ihram, recite the Talbiyah:-
          </p>

          <p>
            &ldquo;Labbayka Allaahumma labbayk, labbayka laa shareeyka laka
            labbayk, innal-hamda wan-ni&#39;mata laka wal-mulk, laa shareeyka
            lak &quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &ldquo;Here I am, O Allaah, here I am. Here I am, you have no
            partner, here I am.&rdquo;
            <br />
            &ldquo;Verily all praise and blessings, and all sovereignty are
            Yours. You have no partner.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            Then you will proceed to Makkah and head to al-Masjid al-Haram,
            while continuously repeating the Talbiyah.

            <strong>Being in Debt while performing Hajj and Umrah</strong>
            <br />
            There are doubts in the minds of people wanting to perform the Hajj
            and Umrah, about whether or not one should perform the pilgrimage
            while being in debt. For answering this question, it is important to
            understand that there are two types of debts.
          </p>

          <p>
            <br />
            <strong>What are Scheduled Debts?</strong>
            <br />
            Scheduled debts are those type of debts that are required to be paid
            back over a fixed period of time in installments. These debts
            typically include a house, car or appliance mortgage, and those
            debts that are to be repaid in one installment on a fixed date.
            Settling scheduled debts before performing Hajj or Umrah is not
            mandatory and you can perform both pilgrimages even if you are
            repaying, or have to repay scheduled debts.
          </p>

          <p>
            <br />
            <strong>What are Non-scheduled Debts</strong>
            <br />
            Non-scheduled debts are those type of debts where there is no
            defined repayment schedule. These debts typically include loans
            taken from family members, friends and professional individual
            lenders.&nbsp;
          </p>

          <p>
            Before embarking for Hajj or Umrah, it is mandatory that you either
            settle the entire non-scheduled debt or take permission from the
            person you have taken the loan. Only after your lender has given you
            permission to perform Hajj or Umrah, you should proceed towards
            performing the pilgrimage.
          </p>

          <p>
            <br />
            <strong>Allah accepts only what is pure</strong>
            <br />
            You should ensure that you pay for the sacred pilgrimage only from
            &ldquo;halal&rdquo; income or that income which is lawful in the
            eyes of Islam. You must understand that Allah is pure and will
            accept only what is pure. It is mandatory that you perform Hajj or
            Umrah by spending money that has been earned only through
            &ldquo;halal&rdquo; means.
          </p>

          <p>
            Prophet Muhammad&nbsp; mentioned the case of a man who, having
            journeyed far, is dishevelled and dusty, and who spreads out his
            hands to the sky saying &ldquo;O Lord! O Lord!&rdquo; while his food
            is haram (unlawful), his drink is haram, his clothing is
            haram,&nbsp;
            <br />
            and he has been nourished with haram, so how can [his supplication]
            be answered?&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            <br />
            <strong>Taking belongings for Umrah &amp; Hajj</strong>
            <br />
            When the faithful are about to embark on the Hajj or Umrah
            pilgrimage, the first thing that comes to their mind concerns the
            number of items they should take along with them on the pilgrimage.
          </p>

          <p>
            While there is no doubt that paying special attention to packing for
            the pilgrimage is important, you should also note that Allah Himself
            says in the Qur&rsquo;an: &ldquo;And take provision for the
            journey&rdquo;. This means that along with physical preparation,
            mental and spiritual preparation is also important.
